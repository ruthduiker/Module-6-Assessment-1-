                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>The common warthog is the only pig species that has adapted to grazing and savanna habitats.[7] Its diet is omnivorous, composed of grasses, roots, berries and other fruits, bark, fungi, insects, eggs and carrion.[8] The diet is seasonably variable, depending on availability of different food items. During the wet seasons, warthogs graze[7] on short perennial grasses.[9] During the dry seasons, they subsist on bulbs, rhizomes, and nutritious roots.</p>
     <p>Warthogs are powerful diggers, using both their snouts and feet. When feeding, they often bend their front feet backwards and move around on the wrists.[10] Calloused pads that protect the wrists during such movement form quite early in the development of the fetus. Although they can dig their own burrows, they commonly occupy abandoned burrows of aardvarks[9] and other animals. The common warthog commonly reverses into burrows, with its head facing the opening and ready to burst out if necessary. Common warthogs will wallow in mud to cope with high temperatures and huddle together to cope with low temperatures.[</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Habitat. Common warthogs live in the grasslands and savanna woodlands of Africa. They prefer open areas, and are found on Mount Kilimanjaro at an elevation of 3,000 meters (9,843 feet), according to ADW. Desert warthogs are found in eastern Africa â€” in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
